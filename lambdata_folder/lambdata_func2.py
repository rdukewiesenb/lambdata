# what's a super statement?
    # used when inheriting a class
        # used after the definition

# a child class will inherit everything from its parent
    # class, even if the child class doesn't
    # explicitly state it.

# error handling: wrapping bool(), int(), cat()
    # around a __ so that we (very) explicitly tell
    # the computer what type of data we're dealing with

# NOTE: Make sure that documentation is clear and concise
